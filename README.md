# Improving Ouster Localization

This project is being undertaken by Michael Hann at the discretion of the Applied Geomatics Research Group. So far the project is unfinished and unverified and should not be used in any industrial or commercial capacity.

The main project is held in __Plotting Ouster IMU Drift.ipynb_

The Sample jupyter notebook is providing guidance from a similar issue.

The complete data files are _C2_IMU.txt_ and _C2_IMU.csv_ (with around 32000 entries) whereas the truncated data is _less_data.txt_ and _less_data.csv_ (with around 1200 entries)

The Kalman filter is held in _KF.py_

Inspirations are documented within the code.
